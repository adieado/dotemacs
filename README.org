# Emacs configuration

## installing emacs

I use [[https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport][Emacs Mac Port]]. Install it using homebrew as described in the readme. Don't forget to run `brew update` before installing it.

## configuration

Fork this repo and then clone it to your `~/.emacs.d`

You might want to add a `secret.org` file to your `~/.emacs.d` folder after you clone the repo to configure personal settings. It's going to be ignored by git.
The file will be evaluated during startup if it exists.

Example of the file:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+TITLE: configuration excluded from github
  ,#+STARTUP: overview

  ,* personal information
    ,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (setq user-full-name "Your Name"
            user-email-address "your@email"
            calendar-latitude 32.0808800
            calendar-longitude 34.7805700
            calendar-location-name "Tel Aviv, Israel")
    ,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC
